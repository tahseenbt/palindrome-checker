# Palindrome checker

A C program, symword.c, that checks if a word passed as its argument is a palindrome. It terminates with exit code 0 for a palindrome and 1 if not. Note: the word can only contain lower case English alphabets.

A shell file, symcheck.sh, that accepts a newline separated list of words as an input and prints whether a particular word is a palindrome.
